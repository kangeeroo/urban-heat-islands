# Urban Heat Islands

Visualize Urban Heat Islands (UHI) in Toulouse - France

Data from meteo stations can be downloaded on the French [open source portal](https://www.data.gouv.fr/)

Each met file is stored as a table (dataframe) with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

A 2D visualization of met stations is realized with [ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

A temperature chart is realized with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Example: temperature chart for all met station on 2019/06/27
